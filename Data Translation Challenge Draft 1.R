# The ACME corporation is considering moving into agricultural inputs in Ghana.
# To get an idea of whom to target for their sales efforts they have hired you to analyze what determines agricultural profit there.
# They are especially interested in what effect household educational attainment and the characteristics of the local area has on profit,
# but if you find other results of interest, they would like to hear those as well.
# They have left the choice of explanatory variables and variable definitions to you,
# but to be able to compare across regions they want  

# Requirements(supposed):
# Analyze what determines agricultural profit there in order to determine who to target sale efforts towards.
# Interested in what effect household educational attainment and the characteristics of the local area has on profit.
# Must compare across regions.
# At least one specification that examines profit per area unit (for example, acre, hectare, or square meters).
# If you find other results of interest, they would like to hear those as well.
